This is a list of things that need to be done in the Web Client
so that the new API for fleet-action can be supported.

TO DO:
shipyard:
  Although all the API changes to shipyard have been done (see t/470_fleet_shipyard.t)
  and (I think) the Lacuna-Web-Client has been changed, I can't get it to work as I
  remember it used to work. I don't know what has changed.

spaceport:
  The spaceport is in an indeterminate state, I can't get it to work but some of the
  API has been done (see t/460_fleet_spaceport.t) for working code.
